    "(Analyzing the Game of Craps) Modify the script of Fig. 4.2 to play 1,000,000  games of craps. Use a wins dictionary to keep track of the number of games won for a particular number of rolls. Similarly, use a losses dictionary to keep track of the number of  games lost for a particular number of rolls. As the simulation proceeds, keep updating the  dictionaries.  \n",
