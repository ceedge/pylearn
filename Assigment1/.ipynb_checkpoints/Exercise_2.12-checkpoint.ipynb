    "(7% Investment Return) Some investment advisors say that it’s reasonable to expect a 7% return over the long term in the stock market. Assuming that you begin with  $1000 and leave your money invested, calculate and display how much money you’ll have  after 10, 20 and 30 years. Use the following formula for determining these amounts:  a = p(1 + r) n \n",
    "\n",
    "p is the original amount invested (i.e., the principal of $1000),  r is the annual rate of return (7%),  n is the number of years (10, 20 or 30) and  a is the amount on deposit at the end of the nth year. \n",
